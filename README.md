# Analyzing Tweets
![Positive Tweets](https://github.com/jcummingsutk/ung_twitter_sentiment/blob/master/img/atl_positive_sentiment.png)
## Summary
In this project I create a recurrent neural network (RNN) for analysis of tweets. The RNN is trained using
a couple of LSTM layers and then tweepy is used to collect tweets on a topic. Any topic can be chosen,
but in this project I currently use Atlanta as a topic.
